## I.  Introduction
***Description***   
Over the years, the gaming industry has grown rapidly, offering a wide range of genres to an expanding audience. From the action-packed adventure games to the immersive role-playing games, each genre has its own unique appeal. However, with such an abundance of choices, it is critical to determine which genres resonate best with the consumers and drive higher sales. Given the importance of understanding consumer preferences and market trends for developers, publishers, and stakeholders, this project delves into a large amount of game sales data across a wide range of game genres. By analyzing the dataset in detail, we seek to identify trends, correlations, and underlying factors that influence the success of various game genres and to predict the best-selling game genres in the gaming market.

***Objective***  
The primary goals of the project are to uncover patterns and insights in game sales data and predict the best-selling game genres by analyzing the sales data across a wide range of game genres. To accomplish this goal, the data will first be preprocessed and then different machine learning advanced classification models will be used to predict the sales of game genres. Eventually, the effectiveness of these models in predicting game genres will be evaluated using metrics such as accuracy, precision, and recall. Visualization techniques will be employed in presenting the insights effectively, contributing to the overarching goal of identifying the key factors influencing the success of different game genres and predicting the best-selling game genres in the gaming market.
