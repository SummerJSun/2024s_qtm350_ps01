## III. Methods
***Data Preprocessing***   
In addition to our target variable, Genre, the dataset includes three additional nominal attributes. To prepare the data for analysis, we will apply one-hot encoding to these non-numeric columns, transforming them into binary representations. For the numerical attributes, we will normalize them using min-max normalization to ensure their values fall within the range of 0 and 1.

To address dimensionality and enhance training efficiency, we will employ principal component analysis (PCA). PCA will allow us to reduce noise and retain only the most relevant features.

</br>

***Classification***  
Our classification task involves predicting the genre of games based on various attributes in the dataset, with Genre serving as our label. This attribute comprises five distinct categories. To accomplish this, we will explore a range of models and assess their performance. The models we plan to utilize include:

* Decision Tree
* K Nearest Neighbor (KNN)
* Random Forest
* Naive Bayes
* Neural Network

To enhance the performance of each model, we will employ parameter tuning through grid search methodology, aiming for optimal results. For robust assessment, we will utilize 5-fold cross-validation, maintaining a train-test split ratio of 70:30.

</br>

***Evaluation and Visualization***  
We will evaluate the performance of our models using metrics such as accuracy, precision, and recall. Additionally, we will employ appropriate visualization techniques, such as scatterplots and line graphs, to illustrate the results effectively. Through this analysis, we aim to identify any correlations between `Genre` and other features, as well as assess the predictive capabilities of the selected models for this particular task.
